    The Personal Data Protection Act of May 10, 2018 (i.e. Journal of Laws 2019, item 1781), applicable in the Republic of Poland, hereinafter referred to as "the Act".<br>
    Due to the lack of fulfilment by the Controller of the conditions indicated in art. 37.1 of the Regulation, the Controller has not appointed the Inspector of Personal Data Protection. Therefore, any contact within the scope of personal data protection shall be addressed directly to the Controller via e-mail to moderator@library.one .<br>
    The Controller shall take special care to respect the privacy of the Users visiting the Website and using the Controller's services. The Controller guarantees the confidentiality of all personal data provided and ensures that all security and personal data protection measures are taken as required by the regulations on personal data protection, including the provisions of the Regulation and the Act. Personal data is collected with due care and properly protected against access by unauthorized persons.<br>
    The Controller, in individual cases, may make decisions in an automated manner but does not use profiling of Users.<br>
    The Controller may collect and process sensitive personal data of the Users, referred to in the Regulation as "special categories of personal data". The Controller shall only collect and process such sensitive personal data that the User voluntarily enters into the Website, such as political opinions, religious beliefs or world views, data concerning sexuality or sexual orientation.<br>
    The Controller does not intend to collect or process data from minors under the age of 16.<br>
    <h1>2. Rights of the User</h1>
    The Website User has the following rights resulting from the processing of their personal data:<br>
    The right to request access to their personal data – the User has the right to obtain confirmation whether or not the Controller is processing their personal data and if so, they are entitled to obtain access to the data and to receive information concerning the data, such as e.g.: purpose of processing, categories of data, information on recipients or categories of recipients to whom the data have been or will be disclosed, planned period for which personal data will be stored or criteria for determining this period; the above right also includes the right to receive a copy of the data free of charge (for any subsequent copies requested by the User, the Controller may charge a reasonable fee resulting from administrative costs),<br>
    the right to rectify personal data (if they are incorrect), which also includes requesting that incomplete personal data be supplemented,<br>
    the right to remove personal data (the so-called "right to be forgotten"), in the following circumstances: when the User's personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected; the User has revoked their consent to their processing and there is no other basis for processing the data; the User has objected to the processing; the personal data has been processed illegally; the personal data must be removed in order to comply with the legal obligation under the European Union law or the law of its Member State to which the Controller is subject,<br>
    the right to restrict data processing when: the User contests the correctness of personal data (for the period allowing the Controller to verify the correctness of the data), the processing is illegal and the User objects to the removal of the data, the Controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of processing, but they are nevertheless necessary for the User to establish, assert or defend claims, the User has raised an objection to the processing until it is determined whether the legally justified grounds on the part of the Controller take precedence over the grounds for objection of the User,<br>
    the right to object to the processing when: the user does not want the Controller to process personal data,<br>
    the right to transfer the data, including the right to receive from the Controller in a structured, commonly used machine-readable format the personal data provided by the User, including the right to request that the personal data be sent by the Controller directly to another controller (if technically possible),<br>
    the right to withdraw consent to data processing at any time (however, withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of consent given before its withdrawal),<br>
    The right to file a complaint with the President of the Office for Personal Data Protection, if the User considers that the processing of personal data violates the provisions of the Regulation.<br>
    In case of any questions related to the processing of personal data and in order to exercise the above rights, please contact the Controller via an e-mail message sent to moderator@library.one .<br>
    <h1>3. Profiling</h1>
    The Controller shall not make decisions about the User based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which would have legal effects against them or in a similar way significantly affect them.<br>
    The Controller may use tools, which can take specific actions depending on information gathered within the framework of tracking mechanisms, but these actions do not have significant influence on the User as they do not differentiate their situation as a client and do not influence the terms of the agreement they can conclude with the Controller within the Website.<br>
    The tools used by the Controller do not grant them access to information that would allow to identify the User. In particular, the Controller has access to the following data: information about the operating system and the Internet browser; viewed subpages; time spent in the Website; transitions between individual subpages; source from which the User comes to the Website; age range; gender; approximate location; interests determined on the basis of activity on the Internet and the Website.<br>
    The above information, for the purposes indicated in point 3, shall not be correlated with the User's personal data stored in the Controller 's databases. This information is anonymous and does not allow for the identification of the User. However, the Controller can not assure that third parties may not be able to identify a User within the meaning of art. 4.1. of the Regulation, in particular when they collate the data from Controller’s databases with their databases.<br>
